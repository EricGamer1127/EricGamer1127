Hi, Iâ€™m @EricGamer1127
I enjoy math, video games, reading, programming, music, robotics, and generally boring myself to death
Currently learning tensor calculus, F=MA level physics, and Spanish level 2
I would like to do a collab on composing music, if I had more time
Reach me on discord at @91IsComposite#7367.

for i in range(1,101):
    print(i**2)

I can finish that in 10 minutes, so a computer would only be about 974.025974 times faster than me.
